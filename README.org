This small project is based on the amazing μgit project by Nikita
Leshenko which is beautifully presented in the site
https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/#

My personal quest is to see how I can follow the python implementation
of μgit and implement something similar in Rust. This is all done as
an educational exercise to get to know better Rust.
